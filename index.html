            <p id="sp">My favorite food is pizza. It's very delicious. My favorite kind of chicken pizza, with some vegetables and cheese, however, I don't care which sauce it is unless it's spicy. <br> Pizza is a very popular food, and there are many pizzerias worldwide, including Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Papa John's, Pizza Corner, and Smokin' Joe's.

        <p>Modern-day pizza was made in Naples 200 to 300 years ago, as what is now known as Neapolitan pizza. It can be sold fresh or frozen, in a whole or in slices of a pizza. <br> In a pizza, there's the original flatbread-like design, on which there's sauce, cheese and toppings(that can include vegetables and meat). On the outside there is a hard layer known as the crust. The ending result is very delicious! There are several types of pizza, variations usually either change one or two things to the main process and/or change toppings. <br> <br>
            But I guess there's not much to say about pizza, if everyone eats it and loves it and thinks that <a id="lpecd" onmouseover="show()" onmouseout="hide()">la pizza è così deliziosa!</a><br></p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Pizza-like foods were made over 7,000 years ago, several notable pizza-like things include flatbread with cheese and dates in 600 B.C. for Persian soldiers, then in Ancient Greece, people added herbs, onion, cheese, and garlic to flatbread, a story written from 29 to 19 B.C. included a pizza-like thing.
            <br> <br> A type of flatbread was named "pizza" and had many pizza-like things 400 years ago, although it was considered "food for the poor people". Then in 1800, after some people became desperate for food and ate tomatoes, they realized it was not poisonous(because it is in the same group of plants as other poisonous plants, people thought it was). It was added to pizza, and it quickly became popular, some people even went to poor places to eat some pizza! In 1807, 54 pizzerias had already opened, the first one being Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba, adding almost 70 more in 50 years! Legend says that a baker, Raffaele Esposito went to the queen of Italy, giving her a pizza with red, white, and green(Italy's national colors). It was called Margherita Pizza.

        <h3>Pizza in the United States</h3>
        <p>In the United States, during the late 19th century, Italian immigrants, and the first pizza shop was made in New York City's Little Italy neighborhood. <br> <br>
            However, pizza really took off when WWII soldiers stationed in Italy returned. Many regional types developed, and now one eighth of the U.S. Population(almost 43 million people!) eat pizza each day.</p>
